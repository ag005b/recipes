DIRECTIONS

Put 4 cups of the flour, yeast, sugar and salt into large bowl.

Add the remaining flour in increments until dough is no longer sticky.
Knead for about 5 minutes until dough is elastic and smooth.
Place dough back into bowl and cover with a damp teatowel and let it rise until double its size- about 1/2 hour.
Punch it down and divide dough into two pieces.
Roll pieces long enough to fill two well oiled loaf pans and leave to rise until dough has reached the rim of the pan.
Bake at 400F for 40 minutes.
Rub hot breads with water and wrap in a teatowel to'sweat' to soften the crust.
